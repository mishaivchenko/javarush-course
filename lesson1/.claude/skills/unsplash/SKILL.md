Search and fetch high-quality photos from Unsplash with automatic attribution.

Quick Start

# Search for photos
./scripts/search.sh "sunset beach"

# Get random photos
./scripts/random.sh "nature" 3

# Track download (when user downloads)
./scripts/track.sh PHOTO_ID
Setup (Interactive)

IMPORTANT: If the script returns UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY not set, handle it interactively:

Ask the user: "I need an Unsplash API key to search for photos. You can get a free key at https://unsplash.com/developers - do you have one?"

Wait for the user to provide their key

Save the key to .env in the project root:

echo "UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=<user_provided_key>" >> .env
Re-run the original search/random command

The skill automatically loads .env from the project root on each run.

The urls object contains different sizes:

raw: Original unprocessed image
full: Full resolution (max width/height: 5472px)
regular: Web display size (1080px wide)
small: Thumbnail (400px wide)
thumb: Small thumbnail (200px wide)
Recommended: Use urls.regular for most web content (best quality/size balance).

Attribution Requirements

CRITICAL: Unsplash requires attribution for all image usage.

Always Include Attribution
When presenting photos to users, you MUST include one of:

attribution_text (for plain text contexts):

Photo by Jane Smith on Unsplash
attribution_html (for HTML/web contexts):

Photo by <a href="...">Jane Smith</a> on <a href="...">Unsplash</a>
Placement Guidelines
Place attribution near the image (below or in caption)
Make it visible and readable
Don't remove or hide the attribution
Attribution is required by Unsplash API terms
Why Attribution Matters
Gives credit to photographers
Required by Unsplash API terms of service
Violating attribution can result in API access suspension

Best Practices

Use specific search terms - More specific queries yield better results
Filter by orientation - Match your layout needs (landscape/portrait)
Always include attribution - Required by API terms
Use regular size for web - Best quality/performance balance
Track actual downloads - Only call track.sh when user downloads
Cache results - Don't re-search for the same keywords
Respect rate limits - Monitor usage in demo mode
More Examples

See detailed usage patterns in: examples/usage-examples.md

Troubleshooting

Scripts not executable:

chmod +x scripts/*.sh
jq not found:

brew install jq  # macOS
API errors:

Check internet connection
Verify API key is set correctly
Check rate limit hasn't been exceeded
Ensure photo_id is valid (for track.sh)
